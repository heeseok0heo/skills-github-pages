2023.04 ~ Now, Pebblous.
Project Achievements and Progress Summary
Until July 2024, I focused on developing the Supply Chain Planning (SCP) engine. I built and tested the LP/PP (Long-term Planning/Production Planning) integrated planning engine along with the testing environment. The SCP engine models the SCM (Supply Chain Management) system through surrogate modeling and utilizes AI to determine key policies based on the environmentâ€™s conditions. It handles order forecasting, corporate order allocation, order prioritization, and LP/PP policy decisions.</description></item><item><title>AI Visualization with CT</title><link>https://skills.aiview.shop/experience/aiview-ct/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 16:31:54 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://skills.aiview.shop/experience/aiview-ct/</guid><description>Given a CSV file containing category names, (x, y) coordinates, and density values, generate a heatmap-based DICOM Image and DICOM Segmentation files for visualization in VolView.
Steps: Data Normalization: Normalize x, y coordinates to the range [0,1]. Normalize density values using the formula: df[&amp;ldquo;z&amp;rdquo;] = np.log1p(df[&amp;ldquo;z&amp;rdquo;] - zmin) / np.log1p(zmax - zmin) Category-wise Density Accumulation: Generate heatmaps for each category by applying Gaussian smoothing with sigma = 0.</description></item><item><title>Old</title><link>https://skills.aiview.shop/experience/old/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 16:24:26 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://skills.aiview.shop/experience/old/</guid><description>Experience
